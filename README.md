# ComputerVision with ImageProcessing
 In this repository, we are implememting `Image Processing` methods by Python, and are designing various `Computer Vision` architectures on numerous custom image dataset.
 
 # Image Processing:
 - RGB_Gray
 - Rotation
 ## TO-DO list:
 - Filtering
 - Edge detection
 - Varoius Histogram methods
 - Image Enhancement
 - many more
 
 # Computer Vision
 - YOLO
 ## TO-DO list:
 - SSD
 - Segmentation
 - other architectures
